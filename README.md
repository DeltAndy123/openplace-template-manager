# openplace.live Template Manager

An advanced template manager for openplace.live.

## Why does this exist?

The first template overlay for WPlace appeared almost instantly after WPlace went live. 
I immediately joined an alliance with a few of my friends and we were hyped! 
We installed Blue Marble, put our pixel arts through an online converter, and started pixeling.
But only a few pixels in, we already longed for features Blue Marble didn't provide. And that's where I stepped in.

In the meantime, another overlay by the name of "WPlace Overlay Pro" appeared. Not as well known as Blue Marble,
but way better in comparison. But I was already committed, and still have a few aces up my sleeve.
With wplace.live Template Manager, names and coordinates are embedded in exported images, providing a seamless and
user-error-free importing experience. Also the ability to only show certain colors in the template overlay makes
working in groups and on bigger projects with many colors a breeze.

## Feature Comparison

**wplace.live Template Manager doesn't contain any botting features, and we'll not accept PRs that implement any.
wplace.live Template Manager will not place any pixels, select the right colors, etc. for you. This is against the
rules. Everything implemented is only there to show where to place pixels.**
